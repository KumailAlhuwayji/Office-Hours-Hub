# Office Hours Hub

## Overview
The **Office Hours Hub** project demonstrates my ability to apply business analysis techniques to design and document a structured system for managing office hour scheduling between university instructors and students.

This self-driven initiative highlights my skills in analyzing, modeling, and documenting real-world academic processes.

## Objectives
- Improve communication and scheduling efficiency between students and instructors  
- Define clear roles and workflows for students, instructors, and administrative staff  
- Produce professional documentation following business analysis best practices  

## Deliverables
- **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**  
- **Use Case Diagram**  
- **Process Flowcharts** for students, instructors, and administrative workflows  

## Approach
1. **Problem Identification**  
   - Observed challenges in managing university office hour schedules  
   - Defined key pain points for both students and faculty  

2. **Business Analysis & Modeling**  
   - Conducted requirement elicitation and structured them into a detailed BRD  
   - Created **Use Case Diagram** to illustrate system interactions  
   - Designed **Flowcharts** for each user role (students, instructors, administration)  

3. **Documentation**  
   - Developed a formal BRD outlining objectives, scope, requirements, and proposed solution  
   - Ensured professional formatting and clarity throughout  

## Tools Used
